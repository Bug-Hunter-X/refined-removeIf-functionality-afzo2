The provided "bug" is not a bug in Kotlin but rather an illustration of the expected, albeit sometimes surprising, behavior of `removeIf()`.  There's no code fix needed because the code itself works correctly according to the Kotlin specification. Understanding how `removeIf()` interacts with the iterators of each collection type (List, Set, Map) is the key to preventing unexpected results.
